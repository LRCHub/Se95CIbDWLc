[00:18.23] Hi, it's been a while
[00:23.36] Since the last time that I saw your smile
[00:31.20] What a perfect fit
[00:34.91] The last piece have fallen into place
[00:41.04] I've been craving to touch you
[00:44.80] Like moonlight stroking your face
[01:01.30] 
[00:48.74] My dear reverie, come hold me near
[00:56.42] Come dance with me in a rosy haze of yesterday
[01:04.67] Reverie, don't drift away
[01:10.71] Please keep me here in your warm embrace
[01:18.33] I'll trade anything for you, for one more day
[01:40.83] 
[01:55.12] I'll perfume your dreams
[02:00.14] With scent of flowers and summer breeze
[02:08.31] Does it matter if it's true?
[02:14.04] It feels a lot more real
[02:17.88] When we whistle through the field
[02:21.70] When I sing this song for you
[02:36.20] 
[02:25.68] My dear reverie, come hold me near
[02:33.29] Come dance with me in a rosy haze of yesterday
[02:41.55] Reverie, don't let me go
[02:47.34] If sanity means I have to hit the road
[02:54.59] Then I don't wanna know anywhere the wind blows
